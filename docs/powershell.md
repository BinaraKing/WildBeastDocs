For you who are running the Windows 10 Creators Update, there is a certain negative thing that comes with this update that you may already have noticed. When you try to open a command prompt in a folder from the context menu, PowerShell has replaced the base CMD in Windows. Not even changing the setting is guaranteed to help. And our guide instructs using base CMD.
  
No worries though! We don't like this either and are hence instructing you how to revert this change. Or, well, work around it.

## Before you begin

**Very important notice:** What you're going to start messing with isn't a toy, it's serious business. The registry editor has a lot of power and can properly screw up your computer if you do this wrong. If tech isn't your strong suit, make sure to follow very carefully.

## First steps

Open the registry editor by pressing Win + R, typing `regedit` and hitting Enter.

As a good safety measure, before you start, export your registry settings somewhere so you can revert to a working config if and when things go haywire. Open the File menu, select Export and put them into a safe place.

You should be good to start hacking around in the registry now.
